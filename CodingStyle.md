# Introduction #

After a quick glance, you may have noticed a slight deviation from standard coding conventions.

I've grown to code with a modified `CamelCase` style... something that I like to call `ProperCamelCase`. Not because it is the "proper" way of doing it (even though I think it is), but because you can think of it as capitalizing proper names.

The only real difference is that I like use capital letters to start off function names. The breakdown is:
  * `ClassName`
  * `FunctionName`
  * `variableName`
  * `_privateVariableName`
  * `_PrivateFunctionName`

This doesn't seem to be a huge deal in C++, but it comes in handy when coding in other languages such as Python.
